The use of AI for dual use has widely been studied (Kang et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2024b; Urbina et al., 2022; Weidinger et al., 2022, 2021). These studies range from taxonomizing potential dual use applications of AI to demonstrat- ing capabilities on cybersecurity attacks. To our knowledge, the ability to perform real-time voice conversations and perform tool use has not been widely available until recently. As such, ours is the first work to demonstrate that voice-enabled\\n\\n4\\n\\nAI agents can perform the actions necessary for common scams.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/scammer-agent.pdf'}, page_content='In this work, we investigate the question: can voice-enabled AI agents perform the tasks needed to conduct common scams? We answer the ques- tion in the affirmative, showing that voice-enabled AI agents can perform common scams in real-time. To do so, we first identify a list of common scams as collected by the government (Paxton, 2024). From these scams, we designed voice- enabled AI agents with directions to conduct these scams with access to simple tools (Figure 1). In this\\n\\nThese scams typically involve a scammer calling a victim to convince them to take actions or re- veal sensitive information. Based on these actions or information, the scammer then typically steals funds from the victim. We provide a list of com- mon scams in Table 1 as provided by the Attorney General of Texasâ€™ office (Paxton, 2024).\\n\\nPerforming these scams can require complex interactions with websites and feedback from the user.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/scammer-agent.pdf'}, page_content='4.4 Discussion of Results\\n\\nWe believe that the capabilities demonstrated in this section are a lower bound for future voice-assisted AI agents. These agents are likely to improve in several ways.\\n\\nFor example, the actions that our agents must take are highly granular, such filling out specific fields, clicking on buttons, and navigating to spe- cific websites. More ergonomic methods of in- teracting with web browsers will likely improve performance. Other agents improve significantly with techniques like retrieval-augmented genera- tion (Lewis et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2024a).\\n\\nBeyond improvements in agents, base models have substantially improved in the past few years (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023). These im- provements have translated to broad improvements in a range of downstream tasks and we anticipate that this will also be the case for efficacy in scams.\\n\\n5 Related Work\\n\\nWe now provide an overview of related work.'),\n",

AI has already been used in the real world to perform scams and produce spam. For example, deepfakes have already been used to scam a British engineering company out of $25 million dollars (Chen, 2024). They are also widely used to create social media spam (Bond, 2024). To our knowledge, autonomous, responsive voice scams are not widely deployed due to technologi- cal limitations. Namely, these scams are currently performed by humans (Hanoch and Wood, 2021). Our work shows that autonomous voices scams are possible with new advances in AI.\\n\\n6 Conclusions\\n\\nAs we have shown, voice-enabled LLM agents can perform the actions necessary to perform common phone scams. These agents are highly capable, can react to changes in the environment, and retry based on faulty information from the victim. Our results highlight the need for future research in protecting victims from such scams.')]"
